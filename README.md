Program to refactor that plays a game of roulette

Dennis Xu and Vanessa Wu

Our new code doesn't overuse if statements and now it's very easy to add new Bets and extend the game.
The refactored code is more complex in that it has more classes, but it's a lot more readable and easier to work on.
We traded off having fewer classes for simplicity in program logic.
We prefer the new code because it's easier to add functionality to the game and it's relatively closed to changes in Game now.
